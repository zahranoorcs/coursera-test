A Movie Trailer Website where users can see my favorite movies and watch the trailers.
 
# Quick Start

  - Download the code
  - Extract compressed file
  - Open terminal and cd to the extracted folder
  - Run the application, `entertainment_center.py`
  - This will open up a page in your web browser
  - Click on the Movie Tile to see youtube trailer

# What's included

Excluding this `README.md` file there are three python files:

  - **entertainment_center.py** - The main entry to the program. Builds the movie list and calls the method to generate
   the web page.
  - **fresh_tomatoes.py** - The provided web page generator. It takes in a list of movies and builds the `HTML` and opens up
  your default browser to display the generated `HTML` page.
  - **media.py** - Contains the class that provides the data structure to hold movie information.
  
A fourth file, `fresh_tomatoes.html`, will be generated when you run the program as described above. 
This file is the actual web page you would see in your browser.
